        <div class="History">
          <h4>History</h4>
          <p class="history">
            Educational technology in way could be traced back to the emergence
            of very early tools, e.g., paintings on cave walls. But usually its
            history is made to start with educational film (1900's) or Sidney
            Pressey's mechanical teaching machines in the 1920..

        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <p class="benefits">
          Educational technology allows students to be much better prepared for
          class, and provides teachers with attractive resources to make their
          classes much more human and sociable, where all students have the
          opportunity to participate regardless of their level.

      </div>

      <h4 class="usage">Usage</h4>
      <p class="usage1">
        Using the new technology in education has become a center point of many
        researches and studies. Modern education has to combine with modern
        technology to come up with best results. The teacher and the student
        both can use the technology to enhance the teaching and learning
        strategies. On the other hand, many people are worried of the possible
        harmful effects of using technology in the classroom or at home. Will
        children lose their ability to relate to other people? Will they become
        dependent on technology to learn?
