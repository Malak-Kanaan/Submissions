            Educational technology in way could be traced back to the emergence
            of very early tools, e.g., paintings on cave walls. But usually its
            history is made to start with educational film (1900's) or Sidney
            Pressey's mechanical teaching machines in the 1920..

            Educational technology allows students to be much better prepared
            for class, and provides teachers with attractive resources to make
            their classes much more human and sociable, where all students have
            the opportunity to participate regardless of their level.

            Using the new technology in education has become a center point of
            many researches and studies. Modern education has to combine with
            modern technology to come up with best results. The teacher and the
            student both can use the technology to enhance the teaching and
            learning strategies. On the other hand, many people are worried of
            the possible harmful effects of using technology in the classroom or
            at home. Will children lose their ability to relate to other people?
            Will they become dependent on technology to learn?
